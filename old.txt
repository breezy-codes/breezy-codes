### Projects and Contributions

#### üìù **[Computer Networks Guide Book](https://breezy-codes.github.io/computer-networks-guide)**  

A comprehensive guide to computer networks, originally developed as a series of projects and tutorials that earned a perfect grade in my Computer Networks subject. Now a full resource site, covering:

- Concepts of computer networking.
- Tutorials for analysing network traffic using Wireshark and configuring devices with CISCO Packet Tracer.
- Python simulations that illustrate different aspects of computer networks.

#### üîí **[The World of Cryptography](https://breezy-codes.github.io/cryptography-guide)**  

An educational site on cryptography, blending theory and practical implementations in Python. This resource includes:

- Mathematical foundations crucial to cryptographic principles, like number theory and matrix algebra.
- Detailed guides on cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, AES, and ECC.
- Historical context and exploration of various classic ciphers.

#### üîí **[Quantum Cryptography](https://breezy-codes.github.io/quantum-cryptography-guide)**  

A project exploring the impact of quantum computing on cryptography, including:

- Basic principles of quantum computing.
- Quantum cryptographic techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD).
- Insights into the potential of quantum computing to break traditional cryptographic algorithms.

#### üöÄ **[Eclectic Sheep Society](https://github.com/breezy-codes/Eclectic-Sheep-Society)**  

A hackathon project addressing alcohol consumption issues in Australia by visualising government statistics and raising awareness.

### Capstone and Community Contributions

During my capstone projects, I contributed extensively to the following GitHub organisations:

- **[SplashKit](https://github.com/splashkit):** Developed new functions for SplashKit core, updated tutorials on the SplashKit website, and took on a leadership role within the capstone project for SplashKit.
- **[Thoth Tech](https://github.com/thoth-tech):** Extended company documentation and contributed to multiple ongoing projects.
  
I also served as a committee member for **Innofes**, collaborating with peers and faculty to drive innovation-focused events.
