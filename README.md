### About Me

- 👋 I’m Brianna, but you can call me Breezy.
- 🎓 I'm currently pursuing an Honours Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security at Deakin University with a WAM of 92.
- 📝 Recipient of the Deakin Scholarhip for Excellence and the Deakin Associate Dean Summer Research Scholarship.
- 🎓 My ADR Scholarship and Honours work focuses on Computer/Telecommunication networks and RAN configurations.
- 🔒 **[Deakin Maths Yearbook 2023](https://figshare.com/articles/book/Mathematics_Yearbook_2023/25824244):** I was the first person to be in the Deakin Maths Yearbook twice, as well as twice in the same year. I wrote a report on Cryptography, and another on Quantum Cryptography.
- 📚 In my own time, I'm studying cryptography, quantum cryptography, quantum mechanics, physics, and calculus.
- 🎯 My research interests include O-RAN, reconfigurable RAN, resource allocation for 6G networks, and cryptography.
- 🚀 After my Bachelor's, I'll be continuing my academic journey with a PhD.

### Current Projects and Research
- 📝 **Research:** Currently working on research in Computer/Telecommunication networks, particularly in O-RAN and reconfigurable RAN for 6G networks. I'm currently working on publishing my first paper to IEEE.
- 🔬 **Machine Learning:** Developing Machine Learning Models to solve different problems within mobile networks as passion projects.
- 📝 **Learning:** Studying quantum mechanics and physics, with a focus on cryptography and resource allocation.

#### Computer Network Based Projects
I created a series of Computer Networks based projects and tutorials that got me a grade of 100 in my Computer Networks subject.
1. 🌐 **[ARP Simulator](https://github.com/breezy-codes/ARP-Simulator):** A simple python program to simulate the ARP process in a local network environment.
2. 🌐 **[Control Plane Simulator](https://github.com/breezy-codes/Control-Plane-Simulator):** Two simple programs to simulate finding the shortest path over the network.
3. 🌐 **[Server Client Program](https://github.com/breezy-codes/Server-Client-Program):** A simple Server Client style program that simulates how they communicate.
4. 🌐 **[Youtube Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Wc20ExYa-rOJPYFocURBIpAePyCJ4Un):** My YouTube playlist of tutorials I made around Computer Networks, CISCO packet Tracer and Wireshark.
5. 🌐 **[Tutorial Articles on my Portfolio](https://briannalaird.com/tutorials):** Text Versions of the tutorials

#### Cryptography and Quantum-Based Projects
1. 🔒 **[Quantum Cryptography](https://github.com/breezy-codes/Quantum-Cryptography):** Contains work I've done surrounding Quantum Cryptography, including code I developed as part of the **[Deakin Maths Yearbook 2023](https://figshare.com/articles/book/Mathematics_Yearbook_2023/25824244)**.
2. 🔒 **[Cryptography Projects](https://github.com/breezy-codes/Cryptography-Projects):** Contains a series of small cryptography projects and programs I've made both during my studies and as projects to help in my own learning and development.

#### Hackathon Project
- 🚀 **[Eclectic Sheep Society](https://github.com/breezy-codes/Eclectic-Sheep-Society):** A collaborative project developed for a hackathon, showcasing the alcohol consumption problem within Australia. Highlighting government statistics on the issue.
