### About Me

- 👋 I’m Brianna, but you can call me Breezy.
- 🎓 I'm currently pursuing an Honours Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security at Deakin University with a WAM of 92.
- 📝 Recipient of the Deakin Scholarhip for Excellence and the Deakin Associate Dean Summer Research Scholarship.
- 🎓 My ADR Scholarship and future Honours work focuses on Computer/Telecommunication networks and RAN configurations.
- 🔒 **[Deakin Maths Yearbook 2023](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-3336557334/view):** I was the first person to be in the Deakin Maths Yearbook twice, as well as twice in the same year. I wrote a report on Cryptography, and another on Quantum Cryptography.
- 📚 In my own time, I'm studying cryptography, quantum cryptography, quantum mechanics, physics, and calculus.
- 🎯 My research interests include O-RAN, reconfigurable RAN, resource allocation for 6G networks, and cryptography.
- 🚀 After my Bachelor's, I'll be continuing my academic journey with a PhD.

### Current Research areas I'm exploring:
- 📝 **Research:** Currently working on research in Computer/Telecommunication networks, particularly in O-RAN and reconfigurable RAN for 6G networks. I'm currently working on publishing my first paper to IEEE.
- 🔬 **Machine Learning:** Developing Machine Learning Models to solve different problems within mobile networks.
- 📝 **Network Optimisation:** Studying otpimisation and constraint programming to learn how to optimise various aspects of mobile networks.

### Projects I'm currently working on:
#### 📝 **[Computer Networks Guide Book](https://breezy-codes.github.io/computer-networks-guide)** 📝
The **Computer Networks Guide Book** is a resource created to help students and enthusiasts understand aspects of computer networks. This guide originated from a series of projects and tutorials that I developed, which earned me a perfect grade in my Computer Networks subject. Realising its value, I have transformed this collection into a comprehensive website. The guide covers a wide range of topics, including:
- Concepts of computer networking.
- Tutorials for Wireshark for analysing network traffic, and tutorials on CISCO Packet Tracer for configuring network devices.
- Step-by-step tutorials on various python simulations to demonstrate different aspects of computer networks and how they work.

#### 🔒 [The World of Cryptography](https://breezy-codes.github.io/cryptography-guide)
**The World of Cryptography** is a resource created to help explain the different aspects of Cryptoraphy. This project is designed to provide both theoretical knowledge of the maths and algorithms, and implementation in python code. The site includes:
- Mathematical foundations, including number theory and matrix algebra, that are crucial for understanding cryptographic principles.
- In-depth guides on various cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA, AES, and ECC.
- An exploration into the history of cryptography and some of the ciphers used historically.

#### 🔒 [Quantum Cryptography](https://breezy-codes.github.io/quantum-cryptography-guide)
**Quantum Cryptography** is an exploratory project focused on the intersection of quantum computing and cryptography. This project is design to show the changes quantum computing brings to the field of cryptography. TIt explores the basics of quantum computing before going into quantum algorithms. This site includes:
- An introduction to quantum computing and its principles.
- Explanations of quantum cryptographic techniques such as quantum key distribution (QKD).
- Insights into how quantum computers can potentially break traditional cryptographic algorithms using Shor's algorithm.

#### Hackathon Project
- 🚀 **[Eclectic Sheep Society](https://github.com/breezy-codes/Eclectic-Sheep-Society):** A collaborative project developed for a hackathon, showcasing the alcohol consumption problem within Australia. Highlighting government statistics on the issue.
