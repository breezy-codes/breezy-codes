## About Me

- 👋 I’m Brianna, but you can call me Breezy.
- 🎓 I'm currently pursuing an Honours Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security at Deakin University with a WAM of 93.
- 📝 Recipient of the Deakin Scholarship for Excellence and the Deakin Associate Dean Summer Research Scholarship.
- 🎓 My honours research focuses on designing a mathematical framework for optimising xhaul networks in beyond 5G, with a focus on O-RAN architectures.
- 🔒 **[Deakin Maths Yearbook 2023](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-3336557334/view):** I was the first person to be featured in the Deakin Maths Yearbook twice, and both times in the same year. My contributions included reports on Cryptography and Quantum Cryptography.
- 🚀 After my Bachelor's, I plan to continue my academic journey with a PhD.

### Current Research Areas

- 📝 **Honours Research in Telecommunications Optimisation:** Currently conducting honours research in computational mathematics and optimisation, with a specific focus on designing frameworks for efficient deployment strategies in telecommunications networks, particularly in x-haul for beyond 5G. This research is motivated by the challenge of improving phone coverage and connectivity in regional Australia.
- 📝 **Mathematics & Optimisation in Network Design:** Exploring advanced mathematical programming and optimisation techniques to address complex challenges in future network architectures, including reconfigurable RAN and cost-effective network deployment.
- 📝 **Current Research Progress:** One paper submitted to a conference, with three additional papers currently in progress, focusing on various aspects of beyond 5G networks, network optimisation, reconfigurable RAN, and deployment strategies for beyond 5G networks.

### Projects and Contributions

#### 📝 **[Computer Networks Guide Book](https://breezy-codes.github.io/computer-networks-guide)**  

A comprehensive guide to computer networks, originally developed as a series of projects and tutorials that earned a perfect grade in my Computer Networks subject. Now a full resource site, covering:

- Concepts of computer networking.
- Tutorials for analysing network traffic using Wireshark and configuring devices with CISCO Packet Tracer.
- Python simulations that illustrate different aspects of computer networks.

#### 🔒 **[The World of Cryptography](https://breezy-codes.github.io/cryptography-guide)**  

An educational site on cryptography, blending theory and practical implementations in Python. This resource includes:

- Mathematical foundations crucial to cryptographic principles, like number theory and matrix algebra.
- Detailed guides on cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, AES, and ECC.
- Historical context and exploration of various classic ciphers.

#### 🔒 **[Quantum Cryptography](https://breezy-codes.github.io/quantum-cryptography-guide)**  

A project exploring the impact of quantum computing on cryptography, including:

- Basic principles of quantum computing.
- Quantum cryptographic techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD).
- Insights into the potential of quantum computing to break traditional cryptographic algorithms.

#### 🚀 **[Eclectic Sheep Society](https://github.com/breezy-codes/Eclectic-Sheep-Society)**  

A hackathon project addressing alcohol consumption issues in Australia by visualising government statistics and raising awareness.

### Capstone and Community Contributions

During my capstone projects, I contributed extensively to the following GitHub organisations:

- **[SplashKit](https://github.com/splashkit):** Developed new functions for SplashKit core, updated tutorials on the SplashKit website, and took on a leadership role within the capstone project for SplashKit.
- **[Thoth Tech](https://github.com/thoth-tech):** Extended company documentation and contributed to multiple ongoing projects.
  
I also served as a committee member for **Innofes**, collaborating with peers and faculty to drive innovation-focused events.
